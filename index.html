    <p>It was late one April evening in 1997, just after finishing some homework. At the time, I was in the habit of turning on MTV to check out the latest music videos (yes, they still played music videos at the time). A promo piece came on detailing a behind-the-scenes look at the new Foo Fighters video, &ldquo;Monkey Wrench,&rdquo; the lead single off their second album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colour_and_the_Shape"><cite>The Colour and the Shape</cite></a>. From the first note I was riveted.</p>

    <p>Now, I had heard of the Foo Fighters before. I appreciated the quirky pop sense of &ldquo;Big Me&rdquo; and their dark, moody cover of Gary Numan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Down in the Park,&rdquo; which appeared on <cite>The X-Files</cite>. But &ldquo;Monkey Wrench&rdquo; changed how I saw them as a band.</p>

    <p>I loved the catchy melody of the chorus, the frenetic start and stop of the moving guitar riff. And the all-in-one-breath, I-will-destroy-you scream bridge? Awe-inspiring. I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time, but this was the gateway drug to Foo Fighters&rsquo; triumphant succession, <cite>The Colour and the Shape</cite>.</p>

    <p>Their debut album, recorded almost entirely by former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, was originally only intended to be a demo. The fact that it was such a hit was a testament to Grohl&rsquo;s amazing musicality (later he would recall recording drums then running to another room to record guitar or bass, still sweaty and shaking).<sup><a href="#cite-1">[1]</a></sup> But it was <cite>The Colour and the Shape</cite> that truly introduced the world to Grohl&rsquo;s fully-formed vision of post-grunge.</p>

    <p>Making the album was not easy, nor was it free from controversy. But out of adversity came an album that managed to merge the aggressive nonconformity of punk rock and cutting edge of metal with the infectious hooks of bubblegum pop and an optimism that had long been forgotten in the cynicism of grunge.</p>

    <h2 class="heading"><span>The</span> Production</h2>
    
    <p>Gil Norton, a British producer previously known for his work with the Pixies and Echo and the Bunnymen, was tapped by Grohl to produce the album. Grohl had been a fan of Norton&rsquo;s previous work with the Pixies, particularly Norton&rsquo;s ability to create a consistent pop sound from the group&rsquo;s noted eccentric style.<sup><a href="#cite-2">[2]</a></sup> What followed were weeks of intense rehearsal and tracking, with band members laying down sometimes a hundred takes for one part.</p>

    <figure>
      <blockquote class="quote-block">
        <p class="quote-block__graph">&hellip;it was frustrating and it was hard and it was long, but at the end of the day you listened back to what you'd done and you understood why you had to do it one million times.</p>
      </blockquote>

    <p>The band initially recorded on a farm in north Washington state, but it was a struggle. Grohl later remarked that it was a &ldquo;bad experience&rdquo;, adding that perhaps they started the process too soon.<sup><a href="cite-4">[4]</a></sup> For whatever reason, most of what was recorded in Washington was scrapped and the band traveled to Los Angeles to re-record, minus drummer William Goldsmith.</p>

    <p>Goldsmith later said in the James Moll documentary <cite>Foo Fighters: Back and Forth</cite> that he had initially been told that the band was doing overdubs and that he wasn&rsquo;t needed. Eventually, though, he found out through bassist Nate Mendell that most of his drumming was being re-recorded. This served as the eventual departure of Goldsmith from the band.<sup><a href="cite-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

    <p>Meanwhile, at the Grandmaster Recorders studio in Hollywood, the rest of the band were busy with Norton crafting Grohl&rsquo;s vision. Norton had worked extensively with Grohl, particularly on the lyrics, coaching Grohl to put more meaning into his sometimes nonsensical lyrics.<sup><a href="cite-6">[6]</a></sup> That coupled with Norton&rsquo;s high performance bar and relentless drive led to a beautifully produced album that was both rough and smooth, beautiful and ugly, loud and soft, harmonious and dissonant, all at once.</p>

    <p>The guitars are meticulously layered, with razor blade crunch lying underneath jangly chime. I remember trying to recreate the guitar tone to no avail, mainly because I was only playing one guitar, not four. But no matter, the guitars to this day still grab my attention and captivate me. The twin, harmonizing octave guitars of &ldquo;My Hero&rdquo; almost brought me to tears the first time I heard them. The instrumental break of &ldquo;Wind Up&rdquo; in particular fascinated me with all its visceral fierceness. It just hits so hard. Of course, the reason it hits so hard isn&rsquo;t just because of the guitars.</p>

    <p>The drums on this album, in my opinion, are some of the greatest drum sounds ever recorded. It was as if Grohl had learned to harness thunder. Goldsmith&rsquo;s departure was controversial and difficult, yes, but I think Grohl&rsquo;s vision could really only be expressed through his own hands. The drums at times sound like they were recorded in an aircraft hangar with a six-foot tall kick. Dave destroys them. To this day, I love seeing him behind a set. He comes alive.</p>

    <h2 class="heading"><span>The</span> Songs</h2>

    <p>I think I&rsquo;ve considered almost every single song on this album to be my favorite at one time or another. You can hear the uncompromising work done on every track. Every word has been agonized over. No guitar is out of place. The songs are sequenced in the perfect order, with tent poles like &ldquo;Monkey Wrench,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Hero,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Everlong&rdquo; spaced evenly throughout, with solid supporting material filling in the spaces between. The result is a musical journey that Dave Grohl described as a therapy session.<sup><a href="cite-7">[7]</a></sup></p>

    <h2 class="heading"><span>The</span> Legacy</h2>

    <p><cite>The Colour and the Shape</cite> was an ambitious project, and it left some scars. Bassist Nate Mendel says it best in the liner notes of the 10th anniversary edition of the album:</p>

    <figure>
      <blockquote class="quote-block">
        <p class="quote-block__graph">While recording this record two marriages fell apart, we lost a drummer, someone nearly went to jail, and we discovered late in the day that record making is hellishly expensive and best done with a budget prepared beforehand.<sup><a href="cite-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
    </figure>

    <p>But the result, for better or for worse, is nothing short of legendary. The Colour and the Shape was certified platinum by the RIAA in 1998,<sup><a href="cite-8">[8]</a></sup> spawned 4 charting singles, sold over 2.3 million copies (their biggest-selling album to date)<sup><a href="cite-9">[9]</a></sup>, and inspired countless musicians to play guitar and scream into a mic, myself included.</p>
